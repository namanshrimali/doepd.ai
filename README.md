# Detecting Objects while Estimating Planes and Depths [doepd]
Please read it dope-d, I'm bad at naming things

## 1. Problem Statement
As the name suggests, this project involves 
* Object detection
* Monocular depth estimation
* Plane Segmentation. 
Introducing, *DoepdNet* (e before p is actually e after p, and d is silent, making it DopeNet.)
